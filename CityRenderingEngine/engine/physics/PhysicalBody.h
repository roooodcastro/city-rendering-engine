/*
 * Author: Rodrigo Castro Azevedo
 *
 * Description: This class represents the physical body of the object. It contains the different attributes that a physical
 * object can have, except for velocity and acceleration. Because I'm using Verlet integration, the velocity
 * can easily be calculated using the actual and previous position of the body, and the acceleration can also be calculated
 * using the forces acting on the body and its mass.
 *
 * To manage collisions, a physical body may have zero, one or more than one collision bodies. If a physical body has no
 * collision bodies, it will not collide with anything and the collision algorithm will ignore it. If it has one or more,
 * collisions will be calculated for each of the bodies and summed and averaged up to respond to it.
